config BRCMSTB_BMEM
	bool "Enable BMEM reserved A/V memory"
	depends on (ARCH_BRCMSTB || BMIPS_GENERIC) && BRCMSTB_MEMORY_API
	help
	  The A/V peripherals (managed by the PI/Nexus middleware) require
	  large, contiguous memory regions to be set aside at boot time.  This
	  option sets those up in a default config that reserves most of
	  memory.  Also allows the user to manually define region sizes and
	  locations using the 'bmem' command line param.  Allows for O_DIRECT
	  I/O using these regions, mmap() from user programs, and
	  ioremap() from kernel drivers.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_CMA
	bool "Broadcom STB CMA"
	depends on ARCH_BRCMSTB && (ARM || ARM64) && CMA && BRCMSTB_MEMORY_API
	help
	  This driver provides the ioctls for manipulating with the reserved
	  areas used by Broadcom middleware, as well as the functions for the
	  kernel interface.  It also provides register and reserve functions
	  for setting up the CMA regions it uses at early boot.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_HUGEPAGES
	bool "Broadcom STB Huge Page Allocator"
	depends on ARCH_BRCMSTB && (ARM || ARM64) && CMA && BRCMSTB_MEMORY_API && !NUMA
	default y
	select ZONE_MOVABLE
	select CONTIG_ALLOC
	help
	  This driver implements a contiguous memory allocator that steals 2MB
	  huge pages from a ZONE_MOVABLE memory zone for use by the Broadcom
	  middleware. This allows better sharing of memory with applications
	  than is available with the fixed boot-time allocations of bmem. It
	  also avoids issues encountered by standard CMA when using large
	  allocations.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_MEMORY_API
	bool "Enable BRCMSTB memory API"
	depends on (ARCH_BRCMSTB || BMIPS_GENERIC)
	select LIBFDT
	help
	  This provides information on how system memory is arranged so that
	  Broadcom STB middleware can determine how to set up its memory heaps.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_PM_DEBUG
	bool "Add debugfs interface for STB suspend/resume driver"
	default y
	depends on BRCMSTB_PM && PM_DEBUG && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  This option enables debugfs support for the STB suspend/resume
	  driver. Specifically, for memory regions to be included or excluded
	  from hashing.

	  If you are unsure, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_SRPD
	tristate "Support enabling DDR self-refresh modes"
	help
	  Provides a sysfs interface for setting the self-refresh timeout
	  value on Broadcom STB memory controllers.
